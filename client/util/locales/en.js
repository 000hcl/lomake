    The questions are meant to arouse discussion around the respective topic, and each programme is suppose to write down the main points of that conversation. 
    Additionally, a separate list of measures is created for the programme itself, and another list regarding the measures for the faculty-wide planning.
    The programmes give also a general assessment of the situation via the colored smileys / traffic lights. These color answers are supposed to answer the question "Where are we now?" in relation
    to the subject at hand. The color answers are meant only as a conversation starter, thus no judgements or conclusions are drawn about the quality of the programme based on them. `,
